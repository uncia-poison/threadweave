# Security and Ethics

ThreadWeave is intended to improve conversational flow while respecting the user's privacy and autonomy.  Use it responsibly and only with the user's explicit consent.  The following guidelines apply:

* **Consent Required.**  Do not enable ThreadWeave without informing the user.  The hidden carryover lines may surprise people if they are unaware of the mechanism.
* **Privacy.**  Carryovers should never expose sensitive or private information from another thread.  Only a concise label is surfaced, and details remain in the original context.
* **Isolation.**  Temporary chats and project‑restricted threads are off‑limits.  This preserves the user's ability to have sealed conversations.
* **Quiet Triggers.**  Choose quiet triggers carefully.  They should be common enough to be invisible but not ambiguous or sensitive.  Document their use if necessary.
* **Transparency.**  If you distribute agents that use ThreadWeave, document the behaviour so that users understand when and why a carryover may appear.
