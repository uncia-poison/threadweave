# ThreadWeave v2.2 ‚Äî Cross‚ÄëThread Carryover for LLMs

**ThreadWeave (TW)** is a behavioural method for language‚Äëmodel agents.  The agent may lift a short top‚Äëline ‚Äúcarryover‚Äù in the active thread to remind the user about unfinished topics from other threads (care, deadlines, creative, domestic), without spamming and without questions.  The scanning depth is as deep as the system allows.

## Features

* **Single carryover line.**  A short line appears at the top of the reply, then the agent continues with the current topic.
* **No immediate repeats.**  The same topic is never repeated in two consecutive agent messages.
* **Isolation aware.**  Temporary chats and threads marked project‚Äëonly are left untouched.
* **Render guard.**  When generating or editing images, the carryover ping is sent as a separate message before the render; if that is impossible, it is added to the next text response.
* **User control.**  Acknowledgment words like `–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–æ`, `—Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–∞`, `–ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è–ª–∞`, `–≤—ã–ø–∏–ª–∞`, `–æ–∫`, `–æ–∫–µ–π`, `üëç`, or `‚úÖ` close a ticket.  Words such as `–ø–æ–∑–∂–µ`, `–ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –º–∞—Ç—á–∞`, or `–∑–∞–≤—Ç—Ä–∞` defer it.  Saying `—Å—Ç–æ–ø` mutes reminders until re‚Äëenabled.

## Quick Start

1. Copy the compact anchor in **PROMPT_ANCHORS.md** into your system or memory layer.  This activates ThreadWeave behaviour.
2. Adjust the lists in **CONFIG/weave.yaml** if you need to customise acknowledgment words, snooze words, priorities, or quiet triggers.
3. Integrate the hook from **src/weave_hooks.py** into the point just before replies are generated.  It will inject carryover lines automatically.

## Quiet Triggers

ThreadWeave can respond to a *quiet trigger*: a common word or emoji that the user already uses (for example `kai`, `thanks`, or `üôè`).  When this token appears in a message, the agent treats it as a hidden cue to check for unclosed tickets and insert a carryover if appropriate.  Configure your preferred trigger(s) in `CONFIG/weave.yaml` under `quiet_triggers`.  Because the trigger is a normal word or emoji, the user does not have to think about it‚Äîit remains invisible in conversation.

## Repository Layout

This repository contains both a minimalist implementation and a more complete engine:
